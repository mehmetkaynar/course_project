**General Notes**

In this repo, I have already provided an `onlinecourse` implementation to which you can add a new assessment feature

- You may choose any cloud platform for deployment.
- Depends on your deployment, you may choose any SQL database Django supported such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)

**ER Diagram**
For your reference, I have prepared the ER diagram design for the new admin_1234 evaluation feature.
